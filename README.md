# Student Management System

- This is a back-end project of a student management system.

- Users could create, retrieve, update or delete students and classes through RESTful APIs, and assign students to the classes.

## Tools Used
- Built RESTful web services with **Java Spring** and **Maven**.
- Utilized **MySQL** databases to store data, and optimized the data flows with **Spring Data JPA**.
- Enabled advanced database mappings with **MyBatis**.
- Implemented user authentication and authorization with **Apache Shiro**.
